Hi 👋🏼.  I am Prachi Jhamb. About me - As a PhD candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Georgia, I am passionate about empirical research at the intersection of environment and development economics. My work primarily focuses on the economics of wild meat hunting in Africa, where I explore the complex relationships between environmental sustainability, economic development, and human well-being.
My ultimate career aspiration is to bring my extensive research experience and technical skill set into the industry, where I aim to design and lead rigorous causal studies that address critical business questions. Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my expertise in econometrics, data analysis, and quantitative methodologies, which I am eager to apply to real-world challenges in economics, finance, and data science.
I am excited about opportunities to collaborate with industry professionals, organizations, and teams who share a commitment to data-driven decision-making and evidence-based solutions. Let's connect and explore how we can work together to drive meaningful and impactful insights in the fields of economics, finance, and data science.
